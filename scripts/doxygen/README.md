generate-commotion-doxygen
==========================

This script is intended to simplify the process of generating [Doxygen](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/) documentation from the Commotion source code for the [Commotion Wireless](https://commotionwireless.net) site; though it could probably be used (with slight modification) for any git repository and Jekyll site, or at least a starting point for such an effort.

In short, it creates a new branch of the commotion-docs repo, clones a project repository, generates a custom doxygen configuration file for that project, runs Doxygen, and places the output into the Jekyll source tree as Markdown files.

For documentation landing pages, by default, the README.md files get used.

## Configuration
All of the configuration for this script is based on the two configuration files distributed with it. They handle defining what repositories and branches to generate Doxygen documentation for, and the general settings for Doxygen.

See the File Descriptions section for more details on the settings in each. 

It is assumed that you have Doxygen already installed on your system. Jekyll is not required, but nice for checking the output.

All of the CSS and layout is handled by files in the Jekyll repository itself; if you are trying to generate documentation for use outside of the Commotions site, you may wish to regenerate the base Doxygen configuration file, and modify to meet your needs.

*NOTE:* If you are using Python <= 2.7 you will need to install the python config parser, in Debian, Ubuntu, Mint etc. it should be the `python-configparser` package that you can install with apt-get (or your favorite package manager).

## Usage

This script contains all of its options in configuration files, so the usage of this script is fairly straightforward:

```./generate-commotion-doxygen.py

## File descriptions

### generate-commotion-doxygen.conf
This is the main configuration file needed for this script to work. This is where you define what project repositories you are building documentation from, as well as Doxygen conf file (see below) that you using, and also paths to various things.

Configuration options are documented there.

*TODO:* In future itterations you will be able to override any Doxygen settings from this file. For now, just edit the Doxygen conf file.

### commotionwireless.doxygen.conf
This is customized version of the default Doxygen configuration file, as generated with the command

```doxygen -g <config_file>

The customizations reflect a few of the concessions for Jekyll and for the Commotion project as a whole; for instance the HTML output is put into .md files.

See the [Doxygen documentation](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/manual/index.html) for more information on the [config file](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/manual/config.html) or general [usage](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/manual/doxygen_usage.html).

### generate-commotion-doxygen.py
This is the actual script that you run. If you are working with Commotion, you should not need to edit this file at all. If you're adapting this to a non-Commotion project, and are unhappy with the results, you may want to read through and make sure that it meets your needs.

### footer.html

This file is a slightly modified version of the default footer generated by a command similar to

```doxygen -w html header.html footer.html stylesheet.css <config_file>
