WASHINGTON, DC — New America Foundation’s Open Technology Institute (OTI) today released the first round of its Commotion Construction Kit, a “do it ourselves” guide for building wireless communications infrastructure. The materials are part of the Commotion project, an open-source communications toolkit that uses mobile phones, computers, and other wireless devices to create decentralized mesh networks and share local services. “In an age of pervasive government surveillance and corporate data mining, the Commotion project is an essential resource for taking control of our communications and data,” saidJoshua Breitbart, Director of Field Operations at OTI. “With the guides we are publishing today, you do not have to be a techie or engineer to build a wireless network with your neighbors.” These documents come from the Commotion project’s effort to design tools and resources that facilitate participatory planning and development of community-controlled communications infrastructure. They are divided into five sections: Planning, Installating and Configurating, Networking, Building and Mounting, and Local Applications. Individuals or groups can use the materials for self-guided learning or to teach workshops or trainings. While some modules are Commotion-specific, many are useful for a variety of community-based technology or communications efforts. OTI developed and piloted the first Commotion Construction Kit elements in partnership with community-based training programs in Detroit and Brooklyn—the Digital Stewards training programs at Allied Media Projects and the Red Hook Initiative. The Work Department, also in Detroit, helped to design the visual language of the tools. Commotion’s first international training in Dharamshala, India provided the opportunity to expand the Commotion Construction Kit and evaluate it in collaboration with community technologists from around India and Nepal. The materials will be shared at the upcoming International Summit for Community Wireless Networks in Berlin, to contribute to the global movement for community-controlled communications and technology. Like the Commotion software, these materials are open source, which means development on them continues and community involvement is critical. This first wave of modules represents a work in progress. OTI welcomes all feedback on these materials and will collaboratively expand and update them. View and download the Commotion Construction Kit on the Commotion website.</p>

  <h3><a href="/blog/2013/09/29/commotion-field-test-pop-mesh-network-downtown-washington-dc" class="blog-teaser-title">Commotion Field Test - Pop-up mesh network, downtown Washington, DC</a></h3>
  <img src="/files/" style="width:15%; height: auto; float: right;" />
  <p class="blog-pubdata">September 29, 2013 georgia</p>
  <p class="blog-excerpt">Introduction:
During a lunch hour in downtown Washington, DC, the Open Technology Institute set up a proof of concept network for distributing Internet service to a public space using a mesh network of multiple mobile routers. Such a network would be useful where there is a sudden need for Internet connectivity, such as a spontaneous event, or conditions that prevent permanent network installation for a planned event. The same network configuration would work for a mobile event, such as a march, although the deployment team did not test for that scenario in this instance. The deployment team used the 25-Sep-2013 Nightly build of Commotion OpenWRT running on Ubiquiti’s omnidirectional Picostation router, with four routers powered by Energizer XP8000 battery packs. The team connected one router to the Internet in OTI’s office at 1899 L St NW and placed it in the south-facing 5th floor window. Team members took the battery-powered routers to nearby intersections to assess the functionality of the firmware, the link quality between the nodes, and the quality of the Internet service at the far point in the network, which was four hops from the gateway (see illustration below).  Approximate location of nodes in the pop-up network. The ad hoc mesh network delivered Internet connectivity to Farragut Square Park from the Open Technology Institute’s 5th floor office several blocks away.
**Results and Observations: **


	OTI staff was able to set up a successful pop-up network using “Commotion WRT Nightly Build 09.25.13” on omnidirectional Ubiquiti Picostation routers up to 4 hops/3 blocks/0.3 miles away from the gateway node in a crowded location in an urban setting.
	Routers in backpacks were able to maintain links roughly one block apart. This distance was impacted by the number of trees, people, and buildings in the area, as well as the height of the router.


**Equipment details: **
 

	4 Ubiquiti Picostations HP (6dBi) Omnidirectional routers (spec)
	4 Energizer XP8000 battery packs (spec)
	Commotion Firmware: Commotion-OpenWRT 25-Sep-2013 DR2 Nightly build (https://commotionwireless.net/download/routers)
	4 Ethernet Cables to connect Picostation to the battery pack
	4 Passive PoE Injector Cable Sets


**Location Details: **


	Moderately busy street during lunch hours with many people walking in the area
	Approximately 10-12 feet tall trees along K St NW
	Closely located 4-6 floor buildings in the area
	Gateway router on the 5th floor of 1899 L St NW
	Mesh network with moving access points within 3 blocks (0.3miles) of the gateway node located at the following intersections:
	
		1828 L St NW: right across the street (33 feet) from the gateway node but at ground level with clear line of sight
		1875 K St NW: clear line of sight from first access point at ground level (500 feet)
		1801 K St NW: clear line of sight from second access point at ground level but with more trees, buildings, and people around (250 feet)
		Farragut Square at the junction of K St NW and Connecticut Avenue: satisfactory line of sight from third access point at the ground level with more trees, buildings, and people around. (0.1miles)
	
	


**Steps followed in the Pop-up Test:**
 OTI team installed a gateway node on the 5th floor glass window of the office building.  Then, four team members connected their four respective picostations to battery packs and carried them in backpacks and purses. The team left the first member of the team with the first router, or node, 33 feet away from the gateway node at 1828 L St NW at ground level. They was able to access the Internet through the mesh network at this point. The remaining team members then walked south towards K St NW along 19th St NW to leave the next team member with the second node 500 feet away from the first node. The team ran “Fing”, a network toolkit, on their phones/mobile devices to note if they were able to ping each other’s nodes. The team was also able to access the Internet on their phones through the mesh at this point.  Splash page when the team accessed the Internet using the mesh network   Using Fing, the team can monitor details of the access point and users of the access point   Using Fing, the team can ping other users of the mesh network.  The remaining team walked east on K St NW towards 18th St NW, and left the third member with the third node 250 feet away from the second node at 1801 K St NW. The team was still able to get to the Internet using the mesh network which was now three hops (nodes) away from the gateway node. Finally, the team continued east towards Farragut Square on K St NW, with the fourth node in the team member’s purse, 0.1 miles away from the third node. The devices were still connected to each other via the mesh network but the signals were weaker, now that we were four hops and 0.3 miles away from the gateway node on a very busy street. When we raised the fourth access point to a higher level, the connection between nodes three and four improved.  Using OLSR-Viz, we see that the connection between the access points is weaker when 4 hops and 0.3 miles away. 



The fourth access point is now raised in position at Farragut Square park 



OLSR-Viz shows that the connection gets better when the fourth Picostation is raised so there is better line of sight between the third access point and itself. 

At Farragut square park, getting to the Internet was more challenging and slower. At one point during the experiment, all the connections on the mesh network were captured on OLSR-Viz (image below).  OLSR-Viz shows the four access points in an “L” shape to the right side of the gateway node. The two other nodes forming a smaller mesh network to the left side of the gateway node are access points located in the OTI office on the same mesh network. </p>

  <img src="/files/" style="width:15%; height: auto; float: right;" />
  <p class="blog-pubdata">September 19, 2013 jking</p>
  <p class="blog-excerpt">Developer Release 2 is the latest stable release of the Commotion platform. It features a focus on improved features around network management, including initial compatibility with external visualization tools and internationalization support.
What is a Commotion release?
 Commotion release versions represent a target set of features for the entire project. Software packages for individual platforms (Linux, Windows, etc.) may be in different stages of development, and are labeled according to their supported features.
Platform Availability
 Currently, only the OpenWRT-based router firmware is DR2 compatible. Other platforms are under active development and are being brought up to feature parity. Current platform revisions can be found on the Official Version Feature Targets page. Pre-compiled software images are available on the Commotion Download page.
New Features


	**Dashboard support: **We've added initial support for Commotion nodes to voluntarily opt-in to reporting basic analytics information to external, web-based dashboards for visualizing the network. The first such dashboard we're supporting is based on the network map for the Freifunk project.
	**Internationalization support:** All web-based Commotion interfaces have had support added for translation into multiple languages, building off of the support included with OpenWRT's LuCI platform. We've included a French translation of the interface, and will be continuing to add other translations.
	**Secure administration interface: **Previously, the web-based admin interface for the nodes was only available via an unencrypted connection. We've now integrated a tutorial into the Quickstart process that introduces users to setting up and manually verifying their SSL connection to the node after setup.


Fixes
 As always, a large number of fixes and changes went into this release since DR1.1, the previous stable branch. We’re currently in the process of overhauling our issue tracking system to use Github, so expect an updated list of fixes soon.
Upcoming changes
 We were planning on rolling out new default IP addressing ranges and dynamic BSSID selection with this release, but we decided it needed more testing and thought given to a smooth rollout. Look for that in a point release coming soon! Also, within the next couple of weeks we’ll be rolling out new testing releases of our Linux and Android versions compatible with DR1 and above.

A 20-computer public computer center hosted at the New York City Housing Authority’s (NYCHA) Miccio Recreation Center now has Internet access following a day of installations by young adults trained by the Open Technology Institute (OTI), the Red Hook Initiative (RHI) and Brooklyn Fiber. Five Red Hook Digital Stewards, young adults engaged in a New York City workforce development effort, installed 6 new wireless routers into the Red Hook WiFi network in the beginning of July 2013. The Stewards connected two new partner institutions to RHI’s existing Red Hook Network with these installations - adding a local school and the NYCHA Miccio Recreation Center to a set of partners including churches, local residents and the Red Hook Initiative’s building. The public areas surrounding these buildings now have access to the Internet as well as local applications running on the neighborhood website.</p>
