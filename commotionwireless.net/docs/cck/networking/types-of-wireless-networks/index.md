## Introduction

Community Wireless Networks can be designed in many ways. To help you understand these different methods for designing networks, this document covers the basics of what different devices do in wireless networks, and how they can be used in different configurations. Using the knowledge and activities in this document, you can work with others to design the wireless network that works best for your community.

Reading and working through [Learn Wireless Basics](/docs/cck/networking/learn-wireless-basics/) before this document will help you with some of the concepts used in designing wireless networks. It provides some necessary background information for this document.

Reading through this material should take about 30 to 45 minutes. Working through the activities, or diving deeper into the subject with a group may take longer.

## Wireless Device Roles

There are three major “modes” a Wi-Fi device can use. These modes define the role a Wi-Fi device has in the network, and networks must be built out of combinations of devices operating in these different modes. How the devices are configured depends on the types of connections you want to use between parts of the network.

In discussing these modes and the examples below, several types of devices are used. In addition to the phones, tablets, and laptops you use in accessing a network, routers make up the hardware that runs the network. These routers are defined in [Learn Networking Basics](/docs/cck/networking/learn-networking-basics/), but for the sake of this document the quick definition of a router is a network device that can connect one network to another, determine what traffic can pass between them, and perform other functions on a network, such as assigning IP addresses.

### The three wireless roles are:

<section id="what-are-the-wireless-challenges">
<h2>What are the Wireless Challenges?</h2>

<p>Each scenario presents a specific challenge or problem that comes up when working with wireless equipment. They are categorized as:</p>

<p><strong>Distance</strong>—Wireless signals lose power the further they travel, no matter the type of antenna.<br />
<img alt="" class="media-image" height="288" src="/files/styles/large/public/CCK_Wireless_Challenges_distance.png" width="510" /></p>

<p><strong>Line of Sight</strong>—Wireless signals can encounter total barriers, preventing connections.<br />
<img alt="" class="media-image" height="241" src="/files/styles/large/public/CCK_Wireless_Challenges_line_of_sight.png" width="510" /></p>

<p><strong>Barriers</strong>—Wireless signals lose signal strength through solid objects.<br />
<img alt="" class="media-image" height="266" src="/files/styles/large/public/CCK_Wireless_Challenges_barriers.png" width="510" /></p>

<p><strong>Interference</strong>—Routers can be too loud, making it impossible for them to hear each other.<br />
<img alt="" class="media-image" height="237" src="/files/styles/large/public/CCK_Wireless_Challenges_wireless_interference.png" width="510" /></p>

<p><strong>Weather</strong>—Weather conditions can disrupt wireless signals.<br />
<img alt="" class="media-image" height="471" src="/files/styles/large/public/CCK_Wireless_Challenges_weather.png" width="510" /></p>

<p><strong>Electrical power issues</strong>—Routers need steady electricity to work correctly.<br />

<h2>Going through the Wireless Challenges</h2>

<p>The Wireless Challenge Problem and Solution sets can be studied at your own pace, if you are going through them on your own. Download the PDF of <a href="/files/cck/networking/3-CCK-Networking-Wireless_Challenges_Scenarios_Problems_and_Solutions.pdf">Problems and Solutions</a>, then go through each scenario one by one. Draw the solution to the problem presented in each case, and then compare your solution to the examples on the pages following. No cheating!</p>

<p>If you are working as a group, we suggest this activity:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Print out just the "Problem" pages, or set aside the "Solution" pages for later.</li>
	<li>Break in to small groups or pairs, or work individually.</li>
	<li>The small groups draw solutions on each flashcard, and save them until everyone is finished.</li>
	<li>The groups then compare the solutions with each other, and finally with the example solutions provided.</li>
</ul>

<p>Keep in mind, there are many possible solutions to the Wireless Challenges presented here. The examples shown are just one or two options. If you think of new solutions, or think we have made a mistake somewhere, please let us know! Get in touch using the <a href="https://commotionwireless.net/contact">feedback form</a>.</p>

<h2>Rules for Solving the Challenges</h2>

<p>When you go through the Wireless Challenges, there are a few guidelines for how to read the connections between nodes, and how to draw your own.</p>

<p><strong>Wireless link quality</strong>—Solid or dashed lines show the strength of the link between two nodes. A solid green line is best; a dashed yellow line is okay; and a dotted pink or red line is a bad or broken link.<br />
<img alt="" class="media-image" height="249" src="/files/CCK_Wireless_Challenges_signal_quality_rules.png" width="510" /></p>

<p><strong>Wireless signal strength</strong>—Routers have different speaking and listening powers.</p>

<p><img alt="" class="media-image" height="295" src="/files/styles/large/public/CCK_Wireless_Challenges_power_levels_rules_2.png" width="480" /><br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Appropriate power levels</strong>—Due to the different speaking and listening powers, choose routers carefully. It is important to use the lowest power router that creates a good link. Using routers that have too much speaking power can cause interference.<br />
<img alt="" class="media-image" height="468" src="/files/CCK_Wireless_Challenges_power_levels_rules.png" width="510" /></p>

<p><strong>Links over long distance</strong>—Some links will need routers that have more power to reach further.<br />
