<h2>Suggest Changes and Report Bugs</h2>

<p>We rely on user feedback to make Commotion better. If you have a feature request or suggestion for how to improve the software, <a href="/contact">send us feedback</a>.<br />
When you run into a problem with the software, report the bug so we can address it.</p>

<h2>Contribute Content</h2>

<p>Because this is a free software project that relies on a global community, you can contribute documentation to the project. We welcome new written documentation that helps users and developers understand the tools.</p>

<p>To make Commotion available as broadly as possible globally, we welcome translation contributions for our documentation and user interface in multiple languages. Find out more about <a href="/docs/localization">localization of Commotion</a>.</p>

<h2>Contribute Code</h2>

<p>Are you a developer working on Android, Windows, Apple iOS, Linux, or web applications? You can help by coding a specific Commotion tool, adding new features, or making development easier for others.</p>

<p>See <a href="/developer/resources">Developer Resources</a> for more information.</p>

<h2>Promote the Project</h2>

<p>Even if youâ€™re not a programmer, you can still help the project grow by spreading the word among your community. Share our blog entries and encourage your friends to get involved and try out Commotion tools. Learn how to set up your own community network by reading our <a href="/docs/get-started">Get Started guide</a>.</p>
