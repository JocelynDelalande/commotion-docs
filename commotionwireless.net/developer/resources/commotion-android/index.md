<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Commotion-Android currently exists in two forms. The original MeshTether version, which ran on rooted stock Android devices, and the new CyanogenMod-based version. Because ad-hoc wifi is not supported in Android (see: <a href="http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=82">Android Issue #82</a>), the original Commotion-Android, currently in master branch is deprecated. All new development should be based on Commotion-Android's CM branch.</p>
