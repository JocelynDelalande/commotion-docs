#Layout SCSS Rules

From [Scalable & Modular Architecture for CSS](https://smacss.com/book/type-layout)

Contains major components such as a header or footer. Minor components are referred to as Modules and have their own section. The major components are referred to as Layout styles.

Layout styles can also be divided into major and minor styles based on reuse. Major layout styles such as header and footer are traditionally styled using ID selectors but take the time to think about the elements that are common across all components of the page and use class selectors where appropriate.
