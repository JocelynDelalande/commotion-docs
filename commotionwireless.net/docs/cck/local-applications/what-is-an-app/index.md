<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Applications are a great way to provide tools that address community specific needs. An application is a program or piece of software designed and written to fulfill a particular purpose, such as a word processor, image editor, navigation system or messaging application. Applications can come in many forms -- a website which you access from a web browser or something that you install on a device such as a smartphone application or software program.

This module will help you understand what applications are and how they work.</p>

<h2>What is an application?</h2>

<p>An application is a program or piece of software designed and written to fulfill a particular purpose, such as a word processor, image editor, navigation system or messaging application. Many of the applications we use today are “network applications,” which get and send information for the application to another computer on a network. For example, website applications are hosted on a web server. A smartphone application or software program is an application that you download to your device (a smartphone or a computer). In network applications -- such as a website, your computer sends a message across the network to a server, which sends your device (the “client”) the content of the webpage in response.</p>
