# Example project config
# A project config contains:
#    As seciton header that serves as a project codename — eg: commotiond. 
#       This is used to construct paths in Jekyll, as well as other short name
#       strings.
#
#       Using the repo name is usually the right call, so that the name space
#       matches what we're using on GitHub.
#
#    "repo"  — The project's remote repository URL that we're using to clone.
#
#    "branch" — A specific branch that you want to build the documentation for.
#        this defaults to whatever the repo's default master is.
#
# Example:
#     [commotiond]
#     repo = https://github.com/opentechinstitute/commotiond.git
#     branch  = master
