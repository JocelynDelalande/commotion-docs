\subsection*{Build Folder Structure}

build/ ├── exe.$<$platform$>$-\/$<$python version$>$=\char`\"{}\char`\"{}$>$/ ├── R\-E\-A\-D\-M\-E.\-md $<$-\/ The file you are reading. ├── resources/ └── scripts/ └──compile\-\_\-ui.\-py

\subsubsection*{exe.-\//}

A set of folders containing all final bundled executables created by cx\-\_\-freeze in the build process.

Built for a 64 bit linux machine with python3.\-3 this will look like\-:

{\ttfamily exe.\-linux-\/x86\-\_\-64-\/3.\-3}

These folders are not tracked by version control

\subsubsection*{scripts/}

All scripts used by the build process

\subsubsection*{resources/}

All resources created during the build process.

This includes\-:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item All bundled extensions
\item Compiled assets file ( commotion\-\_\-assets\-\_\-rc.\-py )
\end{DoxyItemize}

This folder is not tracked by version control

\subsection*{cx\-\_\-freeze instructions}

\subsubsection*{Get cx\-\_\-freeze}

To build cross platform images we use the \href{http://cx-freeze.sourceforge.net/}{\tt cx\-\_\-freeze} tool.

To install cx\-\_\-freeze you can \href{http://cx-freeze.sourceforge.net/index.html}{\tt download} it or \href{http://cx-freeze.sourceforge.net/index.html}{\tt build it} from source using the R\-E\-A\-D\-M\-E provided upon downloading it.

\paragraph*{Fixing Build Errors}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item I can't build cx\-\_\-freeze.
\end{DoxyItemize}

If you encounter an error like the one below it could be that the version of python you are using was compiled without a shared library.

``` /usr/bin/ld\-: cannot find -\/lpython3.\-3 collect2\-: error\-: ld returned 1 exit status error\-: command 'gcc' failed with exit status 1 ```

You will want to reconfigure \& install your version of python using the following option.

``` ./configure --enable-\/shared ```


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item python3.\-3 does not work when I re-\/compile it with enable-\/shared
\end{DoxyItemize}

If you are using python3.\-3, which is the version of python being used for this project you may have some problems with runing python3.\-3 after compiling it with enable-\/shared. The solution to this is to edit /etc/ld.so.\-conf or create something in /etc/ld.so.\-conf.\-d/ to add /usr/local/lib and /usr/local/lib64. Then run ldconfig.

\subsubsection*{Preparing the project for building}

\paragraph*{Adding Extensions to Builds}

Extensions are built-\/in to the Commotion client by adding them to the extension folder and then adding that folder name to the core\-\_\-extensions list in the setup.\-py.

``` core\-\_\-extensions = \mbox{[}\char`\"{}config\-\_\-editor\char`\"{}, \char`\"{}main\-\_\-window\char`\"{}, \char`\"{}your\-\_\-extension\-\_\-name\char`\"{}\mbox{]} ```

\subsubsection*{Creating an executable}

Linux\-:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item go to the root directory of the project.
\item type {\ttfamily make linux}
\item The executables folder will be created in the build directory.
\item run the {\ttfamily Commotion} executable in the executables folder.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsubsection*{The setup script}

The setup.\-py script in the root directory is not a traditional distutils setup.\-py script. It is actually a customized cx\-\_\-freeze setup script. You can find documentation for it on the \href{http://cx-freeze.readthedocs.org/en/latest/distutils.html}{\tt cx\-\_\-freeze docs site} and a searchable mailing list on \href{http://sourceforge.net/p/cx-freeze/mailman/cx-freeze-users/}{\tt sourceforge}.
