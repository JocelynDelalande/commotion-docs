<h2>When to report a bug</h2>

<h3>Verify what you found is actually a bug</h3>
<p>When you experience a bug you should search the mailing list archives to see if someone has experienced the same issue you have come across. Many times what seems like a bug may be an opportunity for a feature that our development team has not thought of yet. If you canâ€™t decide if a issue is a bug or not, please submit it as a bug. The development community would like to know how it can make your experience better. We may not classify it as a bug internally until we are told that a behavior gets in the way of your use of the software.</p>

<h2>How to report a bug</h2>

<p>Bug reports are vital to the Commotion development process. The back-and-forth that accompanies a bug report allows the Commotion team to capture vital observations about the platform's behavior in the field. These conversation allows the developers to improve their understanding of unexpected behavior so they can address it.</p>

<p>The aim of these conversations is to gather as much information as possible. Below is a short list of questions that will help developers recreate your experience in our laboratory.</p>
