  <p>Commotion is a free,&nbsp;open-source communication tool that uses mobile phones, computers, and other wireless devices to create decentralized mesh networks. Commotion provides a way for you to share your Internet connection with the people around you, but it&nbsp;is not a replacement for your Internet connection. Read more about how Commotion works on our <a href="/about/faq">Frequently Asked Questions</a> page.</p>

<p>Wireless mesh networks allow devices to connect directly to each other without going through a centralized point. Mesh networks are self-healing and can grow organically. They also allow for easy sharing of services over the network, such as Internet and applications.</p>
