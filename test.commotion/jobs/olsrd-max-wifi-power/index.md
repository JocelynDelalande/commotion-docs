  <p><strong>Request for Proposal<br />
Commotion Development: OLSRd wifi_max_power Plugin<br />
June 28, 2013</strong></p>

<h2>1. Summary</h2>

<p>The New America Foundation's Open Technology Institute (OTI) is accepting proposals to develop a plugin for OLSRd (http://olsr.org) that adjusts wifi transmission power of a mesh node. This will be a concept to completion production. The purpose of this RFP is to provide a fair evaluation for all candidates and to provide the candidates with the evaluation criteria against which they will be judged.<br />
<br />
OTI has been tasked with building an open source “device-as-infrastructure” distributed communications platform that integrates users’ existing cell phones, Wi-Fi-enabled computers, and other Wi-Fi-capable personal devices to create community- and metro-scale peer-to-peer (mesh) communications networks. OTI is nearing completion on the initial software development phase of an OLSRd-based mesh toolkit and will soon begin production network deployment. A transmit power plugin will help avoid channel congestion in densely populated areas, and will allow network administrators to limit node visibility if desired.</p>

<h2>2. Proposal Guidelines and Requirements</h2>

<p>This is an open and competitive process.<br />
<br />
Proposals must be submitted to oti-tech@opentechinstitute.org no later than July 31, 2013.<br />
<br />
Proposals received after July 31, 2013 will not be considered.<br />
<br />
If you wish to submit alternate solutions, please do so.<br />
<br />
The price you quote should be inclusive. If your price excludes certain fees or charges, you must provide a detailed list of excluded fees with a complete explanation of the nature of those fees. Material costs may be estimated, but receipts are required for reimbursement.<br />
<br />
Provisions of this RFP and the contents of the successful responses are considered available for inclusion in final contractual obligations.</p>

<h2>3. Contract Terms</h2>

<p>OTI will negotiate contract terms upon selection. All contracts are subject to review by OTI's legal counsel, and a project will be awarded upon signing of an agreement or contract, which outlines terms, scope, acceptance terms, budget, and other necessary items.</p>

<h2>4. Purpose, Description, and Objectives</h2>

<p><strong>Purpose</strong><br />
OTI and its partners have developed a mesh networking toolkit for a variety of hardware platforms and<br />
operating systems. In certain environments, such as conferences or modern cities, available wifi channels can easily become saturated due to the density of devices in use. OTI has also encountered network administrators who wish to artificially limit the range of their devices in order to avoid signal bleed into public areas. In both cases, a plugin for OLSRd would allow network administrators to make the necessary adjustments.<br />
<br />
<strong>Description</strong><br />
OTI requests an OLSRd plugin capable of both manual and automatic power adjustment that is fully compatible with both OLSRd and the Commotion Wireless Project. Successful project bids should contain a functional project spec, plugin operating parameters, project budget, and development timeline.<br />
<br />
All Work Product must be licensed under an Open Source Initiative (OSI), Free Software Foundation<br />
(FSF), or Creative Commons (CC) approved license as appropriate to the type of work (e.g. source<br />
code, library, documentation, et. al.).<br />
<br />
OTI will maintain ultimate editorial control of development work and may be called on to assist in any<br />
necessary project coordination.<br />
<br />
<strong>Objective</strong><br />
OTI requests a complete plugin with the following specifications:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Fully compatible with OLSRd</li>
	<li>Fully compatible with the Commotion Wireless Project</li>
	<li>Compliant with any established OLSRd plugin standards</li>
	<li>Robust documentation, including compilation, installation, and usage instructions</li>
</ul>

<p><br />
Whenever possible, code and documentation should be pushed upstream to the OLSRd project.<br />
<br />
Special consideration will be given to projects that make efficient use of&nbsp; the Linux wireless stack's new "Wake on Wifi" capability.</p>

<h2>5. Timeline</h2>

<p>Proposals must be submitted to oti-tech@opentechinstitute.org no later than July 31, 2013.</p>

<h2>6. Budget</h2>

<p>OTI has allocated $45,000 USD for this project. Vendor bids should not exceed this allocation.</p>

<h2>7. About the Open Technology Institute</h2>

<p>The Open Technology Institute (OTI) promotes affordable, universal, and ubiquitous communications networks through partnerships with communities, researchers, industry, and public interest groups. OTI is committed to maximizing the potentials of innovative open technologies by studying their social and economic impacts – particularly for poor, rural, and other under-served constituencies. As an independent non-profit initiative, OTI provides in-depth, objective research, analysis, and findings for policy decision-makers and the general public.<br />
<br />
For the past decade, OTI’s team has pioneered wireless mesh networking. OTI staff include the experts and technologists from the Champaign-Urbana Community Wireless Network and the co-founder of the Ile Sans Fil wireless network in Montreal, Canada. Further, OTI staff have developed wireless technologies deployed domestically in cities like Austin, Texas; New York, New York; and Champaign-Urbana, Illinois as well as internationally in cities like Vienna, Austria; Berlin, Germany; Paris, France; and London, England. OTI has also advised or assisted with organizing and developing locally sustainable wireless projects in Chiang Mai, Thailand; Akwapim, Ghana; Maelodi, South Africa; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Detroit, Michigan; and Washington, D.C.<br />
<br />
Our expertise can be demonstrated through our deployment and development as well as the extensive relationships we have fostered in the open source wireless community.</p>
