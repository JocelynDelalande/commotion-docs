#Style

##Core Elements







##Logos

There are currently several logos used across the Commotion brand.  

###Size considerations
If there is at least 400px of horizontal space, the full Commotion logo is likely the best option.  In smaller spaces, the circle-Co icon is a better fit, but take care not to set it next to the Commotion title. <!-- CoCommotion?-->  Very small logos, such as favicons and toolbar icons, should be a simple Co on a pink background or a Co on a contrasting background.  

###Spacing
Ensure that there is a large enough margin around the logo so as to not crowd other elements of the page or get lost among busy background elements.  The pink logos should rest on a white or black background, as hot pink has a strong tendency to clash with other colors.

##Color
Color usage ratio will vary depending on the interface, and will not be defined here.

##Fonts
For digital materials, Asap should be used.

For older printed materials, Avenir is frequently used, but [Asap](http://www.google.com/fonts#ReviewPlace:refine/Collection:Asap) is recommended going forward.  For signage and materials at events promoting free and open source software (such as LibrePlnet), Asap is to be used as it is released under a free license.

###Sizing
For print, suggested sizes are 40pt Bold Titles, 14pt bold all-caps Subheading (in pink or 80% grey), and 13pt body copy.

For digital, h1 page headings should be white text on black background, with a font-size of 24px/2.5em. Section headings (h2) should be 22px high, regular weight (500), in 80% grey (#333333). Page content itself should be in 14px dark grey or black (#222222 / #000000).  Captions and code snippets should be 12px.  Font should not be smaller than 12px at any point.

<!--In cases where Avenir cannot be used in print, [ASAP](http://www.google.com/fonts#ReviewPlace:refine/Collection:Asap) and [Ubuntu font](http://font.ubuntu.com/) are suitable substitutes. -->

###Font licenses

Asap is released as a free font under the [SIL Open Font License](http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&id=OFL), which allows us to use the font without charge and include it with any software that we make. Coupled with its pleasing appearance, it 

Avenir is a closed-source and proprietary licensed font, and its use should be limited for this reason. 

Ubuntu is released under the [Ubuntu Font License](http://font.ubuntu.com/ufl/), which is loosely based on the OFL.

All three fonts allow us freedom in choosing licenses for both content and software.  Unfortunately, GPL-licensed fonts require that all content and software be licensed under the GPL as well.  This would restrict the other content that we re-use on the website which has been licensed under Creative Commons.  The [UFL](http://font.ubuntu.com/ufl/) and [OFL](http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&id=OFL) have no such restrictions.
