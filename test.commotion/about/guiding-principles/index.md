  <h2>Commotion Project Guiding Principles</h2>

<ul>
	<li><strong>The Commotion project is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source">open source</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software">free software</a> toolkit.</strong> The community welcomes all contributions and conversations that help the project grow and improve in accordance with its mission.<br />
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Commotion’s Mission and Goals are guided by the active developers and community stakeholders who contribute to the project community. Active developers of Commotion projects will guide the development of their individual project.<br />
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li>The Commotion project team encourages communities to customize the software to better meet local needs. We request that all customizations be contributed or communicated back to the Commotion community so that improvements can be reused without undue duplication of effort.<br />
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Work on Commotion should do no harm to existing projects. Projects that implement new code that breaks the existing functionality of other Commotion projects should work with the community of the existing project in order to provide support for the existing functions.<br />
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li>New members may contribute to existing Commotion projects by collaborating with active developers. Each Commotion subproject will maintain an active version-controlled code repository. Guidelines for contribution will be managed by each project’s active developers, and will be posted on each project’s development page.</li>
</ul>
