  <p>These Human Interface Guidelines are maintained by the Open Technology Institute and new versions are released as needed. If you have suggestions for updating them, <a href="/contact">please contact us</a>.</p>

<h2>Suggested future content</h2>

<p>These additional topics will be useful to include in future iterations of this HIG:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Details about how Commotion licences should be referenced or included in the user interface</li>
	<li>Outline of vulnerabilities associated with traffic analysis and radio monitoring</li>
	<li>Should additional log details be available?</li>
	<li>How should users avoid creating duplicate node names?</li>
</ol>
