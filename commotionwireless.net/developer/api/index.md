The Commotion team strives to provide high quality comments in our codebase. We use the widely known and used [Doxygen](http://www.doxygen.org/) commenting style.

Since our project is spread out over a number of [code repositories](https://github.com/opentechinstitute), our API references are broken into multiple sections.

This section of the site is largely generated out of the Commotion source code itself.

For now, there is only [commotiond](commotiond/html) and [commotion-client](commotion-client/html) documentation.
