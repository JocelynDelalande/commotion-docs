  <p><strong>Request for Proposal<br />
Commotion Development: GSM Integration and Security<br />
June 28, 2013</strong></p>

<h2>1. Summary</h2>

<p>The New America Foundation's Open Technology Institute (OTI) is accepting proposals to implement a secure, open source GSM solution that integrates GSM / SIP networks and IP mesh networks, specifically integrated with the Commotion Wireless Project (http://commotionwireless.net). The selected vendor will be contracted to provide a complete open source GSM to IP/mesh network “solution” comprising hardware, software, documentation and training. The software must be comprised of open source GSM tools that integrate mobile technologies into the mesh networking solution and connect wireless mesh, open GSM networks and, where feasible, commercial GSM networks. Additional feature enhancements to open source GSM cellular phone communications are also welcome in vendor proposals.<br />
<br />
The purpose of this RFP is to provide a fair evaluation for all candidates and to provide the candidates with the evaluation criteria against which they will be judged.</p>

<h2>2. Proposal Guidelines and Requirements</h2>

<p>This is an open and competitive process.<br />
Proposals must be submitted to oti-tech@opentechinstitute.org no later than July 31, 2013.<br />
<br />
Proposals received after July 31, 2013 will not be considered.<br />
<br />
If you wish to submit alternate solutions, please do so.<br />
<br />
The price you quote should be inclusive. If your price excludes certain fees or charges, you must provide a detailed list of excluded fees with a complete explanation of the nature of those fees. Material costs may be estimated, but receipts are required for reimbursement.<br />
<br />
Provisions of this RFP and the contents of the successful responses are considered available for inclusion in final contractual obligations.</p>

<h2>3. Contract Terms</h2>

<p><strong>Negotiation of Contract</strong></p>

<p>OTI will negotiate contract terms upon selection. All contracts are subject to review by OTI's legal counsel, and a project will be awarded upon signing of an agreement or contract, which outline complete terms, scope, acceptance terms, budget, vendor work evaluation and acceptance terms, billing and other necessary items.</p>

<h2>4. Purpose, Description, and Objectives</h2>

<p><strong>Purpose</strong><br />
The purpose of this project is to integrate GSM cellular phone networks with the Commotion Wireless Project (http://commotionwireless.net) and to improve the security of GSM cellular phone communication over Commotion networks.<br />
<br />
<strong>Description</strong><br />
Proposals should address the implementation of a secure, open source GSM solution that integrates GSM / SIP networks and IP mesh networks, specifically the Commotion Wireless Project (http://commotionwireless.net). The software must be comprised of open source GSM tools that integrate mobile technologies into the mesh networking solution and connect wireless mesh, open GSM networks and, where feasible, commercial GSM networks. The requested enhancements will greatly improve the security of GSM cellular phone communication over the Commotion network.<br />
<br />
The selected vendor will be contracted to provide a complete open source GSM to IP/mesh network “solution” comprising hardware, software, documentation and training.</p>

<h2>5. Scope of Work</h2>

<p><strong>GSM Hardware, Software and Gateway</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>System must be compatible with real end-user market phones</li>
	<li>Tools for generating SIMs for system users</li>
</ul>

<p><br />
<strong>Security Features</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Develop A5/3 security into open source GSM software under GPL license</li>
	<li>Preference will be given to proposals that add additional security enhancements beyond A5/3</li>
</ul>

<p><br />
<strong>Testing, Debugging and Documentation</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>All features should be fully tested, debugged and documented, suitable to a developer audience</li>
	<li>Provide examples of mass-market recommended handsets and installation documentation</li>
	<li>A set of documentation and training materials for system operators, and a hands-on training course for system operators</li>
	<li>A documentation manual covering the installation, setup, configuration and administration of the hardware and software should be produced, suitable for a technical, non-developer audience</li>
</ul>

<p><br />
All Work Product must be licensed under an Open Source Initiative (OSI), Free Software Foundation (FSF), or Creative Commons (CC) approved license as appropriate to the type of work (e.g. source code, library, documentation, et. al.).<br />
OTI will maintain ultimate editorial control of development work and may be called on to assist in any necessary project coordination.</p>

<h2>5. Timeline</h2>

<p>Proposals must be submitted to oti-tech@opentechinstitute.org no later than July 31, 2013.</p>

<h2>6. Budget</h2>

<p>OTI has allocated $120,000 for this project. Vendor bids should not exceed this allocation.</p>

<h2>7.&nbsp; About the Open Technology Institute</h2>

<p>The Open Technology Institute (OTI) promotes affordable, universal, and ubiquitous communications networks through partnerships with communities, researchers, industry, and public interest groups. OTI is committed to maximizing the potentials of innovative open technologies by studying their social and economic impacts – particularly for poor, rural, and other under-served constituencies. As an independent non-profit initiative, OTI provides in-depth, objective research, analysis, and findings for policy decision-makers and the general public.<br />
<br />
For the past decade, OTI’s team has pioneered wireless mesh networking. OTI staff include the experts and technologists from the Champaign-Urbana Community Wireless Network and the co-founder of the Ile Sans Fil wireless network in Montreal, Canada. Further, OTI staff have developed wireless technologies deployed domestically in cities like Austin, Texas; New York, New York; and Champaign-Urbana, Illinois as well as internationally in cities like Vienna, Austria; Berlin, Germany; Paris, France; and London, England. OTI has also advised or assisted with organizing and developing locally sustainable wireless projects in Chiang Mai, Thailand; Akwapim, Ghana; Maelodi, South Africa; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Detroit, Michigan; and Washington, D.C.<br />
<br />
Our expertise can be demonstrated through our deployment and development as well as the extensive relationships we have fostered in the open source wireless community.<br />
